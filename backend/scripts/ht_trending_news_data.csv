They just run the gamut.” He’ll gladly tell you about the time he saw a pair of the elusive beasts.', 'In 2010, Bakara says, he was summoned by a Florida man who had spotted strange creatures on his property. Using a thermal imager, he and his team were able to make out a pair of creatures emerging from a nearby swamp. “We took turns looking at them,” he says. “They finally figured out we could see them, so they left.”', 'Bakara could talk all day about what’s become his life’s work but clams up on the most obvious questions.

One person signed the guestbook as “Bigfoot,” listing his home as the “Woods.” In the section that asks “How did you hear about us,” the visitor writes: “People were taking my picture.”', 'But Bakara says most visitors treat the museum with respect, at least while they’re on the grounds. “I’m just curious,” says Angie Langellier, who stopped in with her family recently while passing through on a trip from Illinois. “So far, I’ve had nothing that’s convinced me. “But obviously, a lot of people have seen a lot of things that have convinced them.”']"

The claim and the images are fake.', 'A closer look reveals that there are several discrepancies in the images. If you zoom in on one of the images – claiming to be the front side of the note – on the topmost right corner there are two words written, “artistic imagination.” Though that’s enough to prove that the image is a work of imagination, here are some more points.', 'There is no notification regarding the introduction of Rs 1,000 notes on RBI’s official website.', 'A note of any denomination bears a signature of the RBI governor.

Fish species in Amazon wears natural ‘bulletproof vest’ to thwart piranhas,"The fish, also known as pirarucu, grows up to 10 feet (3 meters) long and weighs up to 440 pounds (200 kg).",https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/10/17/Pictures/tropical-lausanne-biggest-freshwater-aquarium-arapaima-aquatis_ffd402f4-f0cb-11e9-8e48-0fd2949bd28d.jpg,Diver Alex Reeson checks on the Arapaima or Pirarucu fishes. (REUTERS),"['One of the world’s largest freshwater fish is protected by the natural equivalent of a “bulletproof vest,” helping it thrive in the dangerous waters of the Amazon River basin with flexible armour-like scales able to withstand ferocious piranha attacks.', 'Researchers from the University of California, San Diego and University of California, Berkeley on Wednesday described the unique structure and impressive properties of the dermal armour of the fish, called Arapaima gigas. They said their findings can help guide development of better body armour for people as well as applications in aerospace design.', 'The fish, also known as pirarucu, gets up to 10 feet (3 meters) long and weighs up to 440 pounds (200 kg). Arapaima, a fish that can breathe air and survive up to a day outside of the water, inhabits rivers in Brazil, Guyana and Peru infested with piranhas, known for razor-sharp teeth, incredible bite strength and deadly feeding frenzies.', 'There long has been an evolutionary arms race in which predators develop ways to kill - like sharp teeth - and other animals develop ways to stay alive like the dermal armour seen in various fish, dinosaurs and mammals over time. Arapaima’s scales, the researchers said, possess all the best attributes of a bulletproof vest, but the elements are better integrated into one solid piece combining imperviousness and flexibility.', '“Such lightweight and tough materials like fish scales are the sexy topics that materials scientists are pursuing,” said Wen Yang, a UCSD materials scientist who helped lead the study published in the journal Matter.', '“It is true that the natural armour is similar to artificial body armour because of the similar scale overlapping system. However, the natural armour such as these fish scales is tough and much lighter, without impeding body flexibility and locomotion,” Yang added. “Remember that the fish scales were developed through hundreds of millions of years. They are very advanced.”', 'The researchers conducted laboratory tests of the scales. The scales, they found, have a hard mineralized outer layer to resist penetration that is bound to a tough-but-flexible inner layer by collagen – the main structural protein in skin and other connective tissues in the body.', 'This structure means the scales can become deformed when bitten by a piranha but are not torn, broken or pierced, protecting the fish from injury.', '“We were able to see how the collagen fibers deform without a catastrophic failure including the mechanisms of twisting, folding, sliding, stretching, delamination,” Yang said.']"
